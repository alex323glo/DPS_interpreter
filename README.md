### Tips to set up the project:
* To fix project dependency conflict, please, add all libraries from "/libs" folder to you project dependencies manually 
(this problem will be fixed soon).
* Use Gradle Wrapper to build and test the project: execute gradlew.bat under Windows, or gradlew (Bash file) under Linux to run gradle 
(learn more about how to use Gradle from [Gradle official website](https://gradle.org/)).
